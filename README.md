# Indoor-Air-quality-monitoring-system

With rapid advancement in technology, living standards have improved substantially at
the cost of environmental deterioration, especially the quality of air. Indoor air quality
has serious effects on the elderly, children, and those with respiratory allergies. Based
on the architecture of the Internet of Things smart home, we constructed an indoor air
quality monitoring system. In this project, we will collect on-site measurements of indoor
environmental data with equipment equipped with sensor modules for fine particulate
matters, CO, and CO2 and compare the collected data with the AQI. Once the concentration
of any gas goes beyond the threshold value, users will be reminded by buzzers.
The collected data will be sent to the cloud to make sure that the user can monitor his/her
roomâ€™s air quality even when they are not in the room. This system is designed using the
Arduino UNO development board and Power over Ethernet(PoE) shield compatible with
Arduino UNO.
